## Quality Management
Resources relevant to the processes, procedures, and responsibilities required to achieve and maintain consistent quality in SaMD products or services.

- [OpenRegulatory Templates](https://github.com/openregulatory/templates) - Templates for ISO 13485, IEC 62304, ISO 14971 and ISO 62366 compliance.

## SaMD Software Development Life Cycle
### Application Lifecycle Management
- [Tuleap](https://www.tuleap.org/) - open source
- [Cairis](https://github.com/cairis-platform/cairis) - An open source platform for building security and usability into your software

### Software Requirements Management
Requirements engineering in SaMD is the systematic process of defining, documenting, and maintaining safety and functional requirements that ensure software meets intended use while complying with regulatory standards. It involves rigorous risk management, traceability, and verification to establish that the software functions safely within its medical context.
- [Doorstop](https://github.com/doorstop-dev/doorstop) - Requirements management using version control.
- [rtm_doorstop](https://github.com/asimon-1/rtm_doorstop) - A tool to generate Requirement Traceability Matrices (RTMs) from Doorstop documents.
- [rmToo](https://github.com/florath/rmtoo) - Free and Open Source Requirements Management Tool, optimised for command-line handling of requirements.
- [RDM](https://github.com/innolitics/rdm) - Regulatory Documentation Manager. Provides Markdown templates and Python scripts to manage IEC 62304, ISO 14971, and FDA 510(k) documentation for software projects.
- [Reqflow](https://goeb.github.io/reqflow/) - Reqflow is a free and open-source tool for traceability of requirements across documents, designed to analyse documents with speed and efficiency.

### Software Architectural Design
- [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) - The C4 model is a lean graphical notation technique for modelling the architecture of software systems.
- [Gaphor](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor) - Gaphor is a UML, SysML, RAAML, and C4 modelling application written in Python.
- [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/) - The Open Source modelling toolkit for creating ArchiMate models and sketches.
- [Modelio](https://www.modelio.org/index.htm) - The Open Source Modelling Environment.

### Threat Modelling
- [Threagile](https://threagile.io/) - Threagile is the open-source threat modelling toolkit which allows users to model an architecture with its assets in an agile declarative fashion as a YAML file directly inside the IDE or any YAML editor.
- [IriusRisk](https://www.iriusrisk.com/community) - An automated threat modelling tool built atop draw.io.
- [Aristiun](https://threat-modeling.com/) - Aristiun gives some helpful example use cases, for example using STRIDE in a healthcare organisation, this tool is a good place to start to increase threat modelling knowledge
- [PLOT4ai](https://plot4.ai/) - A threat modelling library to help you build responsible AI.
- [LINDDUN](https://linddun.org/) - Privacy threat modelling methods.
- [OWASP Threat Dragon](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/)
- [Microsoft Threat Modelling Tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool) - Free 
- [Microsoft Threat Modelling Templates](https://github.com/microsoft/threat-modeling-templates) - 
- [AWS Threat Composer](https://awslabs.github.io/threat-composer/workspaces/default/dashboard) - Free 

### Software Unit Implementation
- [Ferrocene](https://ferrocene.dev/en/) - Ferrocene, a Rust compiler toolchain, is the first open-source toolchain to achieve IEC 62304 Class C qualification for medical device software, enabling developers to use Rust for safety-critical applications in the medical industry.

### Verification and Validation
