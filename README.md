## SaMD Software Development Life Cycle
### Application Lifecycle Management
ALM manages the complete application lifecycle, covering governance, development, and maintenance across disciplines from requirements to release. ALM tools standardize team communication and automate development processes to achieve efficient, predictable software delivery.

- [Cairis](https://github.com/cairis-platform/cairis) - An open source platform for usability, requirements, and risk analysis.

### Software Requirements Management
Requirements engineering in SaMD is the systematic process of defining, documenting, and maintaining safety and functional requirements that ensure software meets intended use while complying with regulatory standards. It involves rigorous risk management, traceability, and verification to establish that the software functions safely within its medical context.
- [Doorstop](https://github.com/doorstop-dev/doorstop) - Requirements management using version control.
- [rtm_doorstop](https://github.com/asimon-1/rtm_doorstop) - A tool to generate Requirement Traceability Matrices (RTMs) from Doorstop documents.

### Software Architectural Design
Software architectural design focuses on creating a robust and safe structure for the software, ensuring it meets medical device standards and user needs, while also enabling lifecycle processes like agile development, verification, validation, and maintenance. 
- [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) - The C4 model is a lean graphical notation technique for modelling the architecture of software systems.
- [Gaphor](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor) - Gaphor is a UML, SysML, RAAML, and C4 modelling application written in Python.
- [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/) - The Open Source modelling toolkit for creating ArchiMate models and sketches.
- [Modelio](https://www.modelio.org/index.htm) - The Open Source Modelling Environment.

### Security Analysis
Threat modelling is a structured process that helps identify potential threats and vulnerabilities in medical devices early in the development lifecycle, allowing for the implementation of appropriate security measures. 

- [Threagile](https://threagile.io/) - Threagile is the open-source threat modelling toolkit which allows users to model an architecture with its assets in an agile declarative fashion as a YAML file directly inside the IDE or any YAML editor.
- [IriusRisk](https://www.iriusrisk.com/community) - An automated threat modelling tool built atop draw.io.
- [Aristiun](https://threat-modeling.com/) - Aristiun gives some helpful example use cases, for example using STRIDE in a healthcare organisation, this tool is a good place to start to increase threat modelling knowledge
- [PLOT4ai](https://plot4.ai/) - A threat modelling library to help you build responsible AI.
- [LINDDUN](https://linddun.org/) - Privacy threat modelling methods.
- [OWASP Threat Dragon](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/) - creates threat model diagrams supporting STRIDE,  LINDDUN, CIA, DIE, and PLOT4ai methodologies. Generates modelling diagrams and implements a rule engine to auto-generate threats and their mitigations.
- [Microsoft Threat Modelling Tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool) - Free threat modelling tool (Windows only).
- [Microsoft Threat Modelling Templates](https://github.com/microsoft/threat-modeling-templates) - templates for above including for a medical device.
- [AWS Threat Composer](https://github.com/awslabs/threat-composer) - Open source threat modelling tool.
### Software Unit Implementation
Software unit implementation is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle where developers translate designs and specifications into actual, working code. 
- [Ferrocene](https://ferrocene.dev/en/) - Ferrocene, a Rust compiler toolchain, is the first open-source toolchain to achieve IEC 62304 Class C qualification for medical device software, enabling developers to use Rust for safety-critical applications in the medical industry.

### Verification and Validation
Verification and validation are the two essential processes used to ensure the quality of a SaMD product or system. Verification checks if the product is built correctly according to specifications, while validation checks if the product meets the user's needs and requirements. 
- [QaraTMS](https://github.com/a13xh7/QaraTMS) - open source test management software for managing test suites, test cases, test plans, test runs and documentation.
