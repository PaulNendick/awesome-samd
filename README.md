## SaMD Software Development Life Cycle

### Software Requirements Management
Requirements engineering in medical device software (IEC 62304) is the systematic process of defining, documenting, and maintaining safety and functional requirements that ensure software meets intended use while complying with regulatory standards. It involves rigorous risk management, traceability, and verification to establish that the software functions safely within its medical context.
- [Doorstop](https://github.com/doorstop-dev/doorstop) - Requirements management using version control.
- [rtm_doorstop](https://github.com/asimon-1/rtm_doorstop) - A tool to generate Requirement Traceability Matrices (RTMs) from Doorstop documents.
- [Reqflow](https://goeb.github.io/reqflow/) - Reqflow is a free and open-source tool for traceability of requirements across documents, designed to analyse documents with speed and efficiency.
- [rmToo](https://github.com/florath/rmtoo) - Free and Open Source Requirements Management Tool. 
- [OSRMT](https://github.com/osrmt/osrmt) - Open Source Requirements Management Tool for defining and managing software requirements.

### Software Architectural Design
- [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) - The C4 model is a lean graphical notation technique for modelling the architecture of software systems.
- [Gaphor](https://gaphor.org/) - Gaphor is a UML, SysML, RAAML, and C4 modelling application written in Python.
- [Cairis](https://cairis.org/) - An open source platform for building security and usability into your software
- [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/) - The Open Source modelling toolkit for creating ArchiMate models and sketches.
- [Modelio](https://www.modelio.org/index.htm) - The Open Source Modelling Environment.

### Software Unit Implementation and Verification
- [Ferrocene](https://ferrocene.dev/en/) - Ferrocene, a Rust compiler toolchain, is the first open-source toolchain to achieve IEC 62304 Class C qualification for medical device software, enabling developers to use Rust for safety-critical applications in the medical industry.
### Software Integration and Integration Testing
### Software System Testing
- [SonarQube](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube) - : SonarQube  is a powerful open-source platform that can perform static code analysis for a wide range of programming languages, helping to identify potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code quality issues without executing the code. 
#### Cybersecurity Risk Management
